### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Phat Pham**, a lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Ho Chi Minh Vietnam.

**I'm great at building MVPs**. Lately I've been focusing on Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless to build performance, scalable & highly available distributed systems.

**Currently I'm working as Solutions Architect** at [FPT Software](https://www.fpt-software.com), building & maintaining several projects for FinTech & Crypto Trading companies in Europe.

**I write code & read books in my free time**. Check [/boringcodes](https://github.com/boringcodes) for what I've been writing for fun.

**I'm also studying M.S. in Computer Science**, major in Artificial Intelligent on the weekend.
