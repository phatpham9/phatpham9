### Hi there 👋

**I'm Phat Pham**, a lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Ho Chi Minh Vietnam.

**I'm great at building MVPs**. Lately I've been focusing on Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless to build performance, scalable & highly available distributed systems.

**Currently I'm taking a break after my own startup failed**.

**I write code & read books in my free time**, check [github.com/phatpham9](https://github.com/phatpham9) for my open source projects. I'm also studying M.S. in Computer Science on the weekend.
