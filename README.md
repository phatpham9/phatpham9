### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Phat Pham**, a lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Ho Chi Minh Vietnam.

**I'm great at building MVPs**. Lately I've been focusing on Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless to build performance, scalable & highly available distributed systems.

**I write code & read books in my free time**. Check [github.com/phatpham9](https://github.com/phatpham9) for my open source projects.

**Currently I'm taking a break after my own startup failed** but I still write code for fun in my free-time (check [/boringcodes](https://github.com/boringcodes)). And I'm also studying M.S. in Computer Science on the weekend.

Find out more about me at my personal website [onroads.xyz](https://onroads.xyz)
